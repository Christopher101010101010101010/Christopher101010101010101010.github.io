            &emsp;For the databases artifact, I have chosen the final project from Client-Server<br>
            Development that was originally engineered in February of 2024. This software package<br>
            was designed as a lightweight interface between a client program and a MongoDB database<br>
            hosted on a server that allowed users to perform statistical analysis on large numbers<br>
            of animals located across the globe. When originally implementing this program a CRUD<br>
            (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) database interface was programmed but never fully<br>
            integrated into the client programâ€™s interface software and so this presented an excellent<br>
            opportunity to finish the development of the UX for inclusion of database object creation,<br>
            existing animal information updates, and removal of existing animal records from the database.<br>
            Further, the updates to this program required the implementation of button GUIs, on click<br>
            routines for popup window activation, and button activation routines for data submission to the<br>
            record creation, record update, and record removal database functions. In February 2024 I<br>
            originally engineered the final project of Client-Server Development that will serve as my<br>
            databases artifact.<br><br>         

            &emsp;This round of updates has been a strong reminder of front-end development principles<br>
            and as anticipated has satisfied course outcomes #3, and #4. During my integration of database<br>
            object creation, record update, and record deletion interfaces I was not presented with strong<br>
            opportunities to apply course outcome #5 as originally anticipated, i.e. develop and apply a data<br>
            security mindset though course outcomes #3, and #4 were met through the design and implementation<br>
            of these new features. I was reminded heavily of the relationship between programming for front-end<br>
            structures, i.e. buttons and popup windows, and front-end events, i.e. button activation and<br>
            spawning new windows, in this series of updates. The greatest challenge presented during the<br>
            implementation of these new features was differentiating the record variables to allow users to enter<br>
            for new animal records and allow users to change for updating existing animal records; though the most<br>
            technically cumbersome task was determining how to generate popup windows that could acquire user input<br>
            to transfer to the relevant database functions. Course outcomes #3 and #4 were satisfied by the patches<br>
            to this artifact that reminded me of the intricacies of front-end development.
